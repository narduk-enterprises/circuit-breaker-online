# SEO & Sitemap Fix

## What Changed

### 1. Sitemap — Clean URLs Only

**File:** `server/api/__sitemap__/urls.ts`

Previously, the sitemap included query-param category URLs like:

```
/products?category=Circuit%20Breakers
```

Now the sitemap emits clean path-based category URLs:

```
/products/category/circuit-breakers
```

All sitemap entries are guaranteed to be free of `?` and `#` characters.

### 2. Global SEO Policy Plugin

**File:** `app/plugins/seo-policy.ts`

A Nuxt plugin that runs on both SSR and client navigation:

- **Canonical URL**: Always set to `https://circuitbreaker.online` + route path
  (no query string)
- **Robots**: `index,follow` for clean pages, `noindex,follow` for any page with
  query params

This prevents Google from indexing filtered/parameterized product pages while
keeping the clean category and product pages indexable.

### 3. Clean Category Pages

**File:** `app/pages/products/category/[slug].vue`

New page route that renders a category-specific product listing at
`/products/category/{slug}`. Includes:

- Proper SEO meta tags (title, description, OG image)
- Schema.org CollectionPage + Breadcrumb structured data
- Product grid with pagination
- Subcategory links

**API:** `server/api/categories/[slug].get.ts` — resolves a category slug to its
name and subcategories.

### 4. Internal Link Updates

All internal links now use clean category paths instead of query params:

- Homepage category grid → `/products/category/{slug}`
- Equipment pages → `/products/category/{slug}`
- Product detail breadcrumbs → `/products/category/{slug}`
- Shop services page → `/products/category/renewal-replacement-parts`

### 5. Category Slug Utility

**File:** `app/composables/useCategorySlug.ts`

Converts a category name to its URL slug: `"Circuit Breakers"` →
`"circuit-breakers"`.

| `/products?category=X`      | ❌ No (noindex) | Query-param filtered pages            |
| `/products?page=2`          | ❌ No (noindex) | Paginated pages                       |
| `/products?sort=newest`     | ❌ No (noindex) | Sorted pages                          |

## How to Add a New Indexable Category

1. Ensure the category exists in the `categories` table with a `slug` and
   `parent = NULL` (top-level category).
2. The sitemap API (`server/api/__sitemap__/urls.ts`) automatically picks up all
   parent categories.
3. The page at `/products/category/{slug}` will resolve automatically via the
   `[slug].vue` dynamic route.
4. Link to the category using `/products/category/{slug}` — never
   `/products?category=Name`.

## Verification Commands

Check total sitemap URLs:

```bash
curl -sS https://circuitbreaker.online/sitemap.xml | grep -c "<url>"
```

Verify no query params in sitemap (must return 0):

```bash
curl -sS https://circuitbreaker.online/sitemap.xml | grep -F -c '?'
```

Run regression tests locally:

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm test
```
